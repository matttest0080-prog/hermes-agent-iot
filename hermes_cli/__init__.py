# Fork: keep a real literal as the fallback. The fork's packaging checks assert the shipped
# version equals pyproject's, and Pi2 devices install the wheel with plain pip -- no install
# stamp is written, so upstream's "0.0.0" placeholder would regress `hermes --version` there.
# The stamp still wins whenever this tree has one (upstream's old-updater contract).

    tests/compat/old_updater_surface.json freezes that import. In-tree code resolves
    identity through hermes_cli.version_info.get_version_info(); this reads only the
    install stamp -- never git. The stamp wins when one exists; without one the fork
    answers with its literal package version (upstream returns the "0.0.0" placeholder).

    Lazy because ``pm`` is not importable when this package loads: a venv
    editable-installed from a pre-PM tree maps only the top-level packages it knew
    at install time, and the repo root reaches ``sys.path`` only once
    ``hermes_bootstrap`` runs -- after this ``__init__``, from ``hermes_cli.main``.
