# Pick the release tags the install/update E2E should update FROM.
#
# Emits a JSON array of tag names on stdout, suitable for a GitHub Actions
# matrix (`fromJSON`). Choosing at runtime rather than hardcoding keeps the
# matrix honest as releases land: a pinned list silently stops covering the
# newest release the day after it ships, and pins the "oldest" forever even
# after it stops being a version anyone still runs.
#
# Selection: the newest tag, the oldest tag, and evenly spaced tags in between.
# Newest catches "did the last release break updating?", oldest is the longest
# upgrade jump anyone can still make, and the spread samples the migrations in
# between (config-schema bumps, venv layout changes, dependency floors).
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/sandbox/pick-release-tags.sh [--count N] [--repo DIR]
#
#   --count   how many tags to emit (default 5, minimum 1). Fewer tags than
#             requested emits all of them.
#   --repo    repository to read tags from (default: this checkout).
#
# Reads tags from the local checkout, so it needs one fetched with tags
# (actions/checkout with fetch-depth: 0, or `fetch-tags: true`). A shallow
# checkout has no tags and this exits non-zero rather than silently emitting an
# empty matrix.
#
# Accept upstream calendar releases plus this fork's IoT package and Pi2 image
# release schemes. Only tags reachable from the checked-out branch are valid
# update sources; legacy Pi2 history is intentionally unrelated to pi2-lite.
